# CRF-NER
Conditional Random Fields for Named Entity Recognition

1. Anatomical Entity  Model Training Notebook.ipynb:
   A notebook i used for training a CRF NER model to identify anatomical entities, using the Anatomical Entity Mention Recognition (AnatEM) dataset. The original dataset can be found here:

2. Disease Entity Model Training Notebook.ipynb
   A notebook i used for training a CRF NER model to identify disease entities, using he gc5cdr & ncbi disease datasets. I found the dataset on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/adityaanup/biobert-named-entity-recognition-datasets
